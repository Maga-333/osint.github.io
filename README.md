        <h1>Open Source Intelligence</h1>
        <p align="justify">Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the insight gained from processing and analyzing public 
            data sources such as broadcast TV and radio, social media, 
            and websites. These sources provide data in text, video, image, and audio formats.It is include to cyber defence

        <a  href = "https://www.nslookup.io/" class="custom-link"><u>1. IP Address</u></a>
        </b></h2>
        <p align="justify">
            An A record (Address Record) points a domain or subdomain to an IP address. 
            For example, an A Record is used to point a logical domain name, such as "google.com," to the IP address of Google's
             hosting server, "74.125.224.147" 
        </p>
        <h4><i>=> CNAME RECORD:</i></h4>
        <p align="justify">A CNAME (Canonical Name) points one domain or subdomain to another domain name, allowing you to update one A Record 
            each time you make a change, regardless of how many Host Records need to resolve to that IP address.</p>
            <h4><i>=> MX RECORD:</i></h4>
        <p align="justify">An MX Entry (Mail Exchanger) directs email to a particular mail server. Like a CNAME, MX Entries must point to a 
            domain and never point directly to an IP address.</p>
            <h4><i>=> TXT RECORD:</i></h4>
            <p align="justify">A TXT (Text) record was originally intended for human-readable text. These records are dynamic and can be used for 
                several purposes. TXT records are commonly used for Google Verification.
            </p>
            <h4><i>=> SRV RECORD:</i></h4>
            <p align="justify">An SRV (Service) record points one domain to another domain name using a specific destination port. In addition, 
                SRV records allow specific services, such as VOIP or IM, to be directed to a separate location.</p>
                <h4><i>=> AAAA RECORD:</i></h4>
                <p align="justify">The AAAA record is similar to the A record, allowing you to point the domain to an Ipv6 address. </p>
